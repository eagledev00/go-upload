# go-upload

Simple go app for file uploads.

This has a rudimentary web UI if needed and turned on with `ENABLE_WEBFORM` environment variable
and it can serve the files from uploaded directory.

However, I mostly use it from [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) with a custom uploader,
and use nginx to proxy the public url into storage path
